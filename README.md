### Whats up 👋 I'm 404, and you are..?

## I've been coding Java for 7 months. I'm planning on learning C# next.
- 💎 I learned Java by coding Forge Mods for Minecraft. Hacked clients specifically. 🤫
- 🎃 I now code Paper plugins and I'm currently working on one of my biggest projects called AmongSus.
- 💻 I'm currently on a development team for a network called "The Atlas".
